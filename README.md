# Ficus

Ficus is a library of Fast, Immutable Collections, mostly based on tree structures.

## Documentation

Coming soon. For the moment, consider this an alpha release, suitable for testing with. Do not use this in production yet.

## Why the name Ficus?

It starts with F as so many projects do, and it's the name of many different kinds of trees. Plus, there were no other major projects using the name Ficus that I could find, so there was no chance of confusion.

## What about FSharpx.Collections?

Once this code is stable and well-tested, I [plan to submit the RRBVector implementation to FSharpx.Collections](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpx.Collections/issues/72). You can help that along by downloading the Ficus NuGet package, testing it, and reporting any bugs you find.
